Simulate an E-Commerce Application!

1. Start
This project involves building a simulated e-commerce application with a focus on data management.

1.2 Components
The application should consist of a program that simulates the sale of e-commerce goods online by streaming completed orders to Apache Kafka. Additionally, there should be programs that consume this data for different purposes.

1.2.1 First Consumer
We need a consumer that tracks how many orders have been received from 00:00 until the current time (with a reset point every day at 00:00).

1.2.2 Second Consumer
We want to know some details about sales:

Total sales for the current day so far
Total sales in the last hour
1.2.3 Third Consumer
Every 24 hours (at 00:00), a daily report should be generated. The report should include:

The total number of orders
The total sales amount
The number of each product sold during the day
This report should be saved to a file with the current date as the filename.

1.2.4 Fourth Consumer
For every sale, the stock balance for the product should be updated. This means that a stock inventory must be available to decrement as sales occur (keep this in mind when simulating the sales mentioned above).

1.3 Exam Components
The examination will include:

A 10-minute presentation of the project (with the application running live)
A 2-page report about the project
The application must be visually interactive and allow users to actively follow:

The number of orders received since 00:00
The total sales amount for the current day, and so on


Additional Requirements for a Higher Grade (VG)
Order Management System

Each order should have a percentage chance of being processed after the sale.
When processed, the order should be "handled," and an email notification should be sent to the customer (write this information to a file).
The order should then be marked as handled, which means there must be monitoring or tracking for processed orders.
These processed orders should be sent to their own Kafka topic.

Monitoring Requirements
There should be active monitoring of the number of orders processed during:

The last 5 minutes
The last 30 minutes
The last hour
The last 2 hours
The average handling rate per 5-minute interval over the last 2 hours
